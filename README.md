## Introduction

Howdy partner! Here we present the first online multiplayer quantum game. Each player is given initial and final quantum states. The objective of the game is to build a quantum circuit to achieve such the transformation. The first to submit the correct circuit wins the duel and becomes the fastest draw in the quantum west!

## Gameplay
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](juego.PNG)[]
- The game begins when two players open the Quantum Duel game web page. 
- The initial and final quantum states are given.
- The players drag and drop the provided quantum gates to make a correct quantum circuit for the problem.
- The FIRST player who gets the correct quantum circuit WINS!

## Technical details

Once the game begins, a problem of the initial and final quantum states are randomly generated by the levels generator module. Next, the user circuit converter transforms the user input circuit into a Qiskit quantum circuit. The answer is then checked. Lastly, the result is sent to the players when the correct answer is detected.    

### Development tools

- The main computing module and the server are developed by **Python with Qiskit and Tornado web server**.
- The front-end languages are **JavaScript, CSS, and HTML**.
